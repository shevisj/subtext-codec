Today, I'm goin to teach you about steganography.  In my previous posts about ciph
er's toolkit and other crypto posts, you probably realized by now, I am an open
support of encryption for all your needs.

This time I want you, dear reader,  learn steganographic technique that will help you 
store your files on websites without the fear of detection by their admins and other 
third parties that are interested to spy and steal our personal data.

### What's Stegnanography?
---------------------------

Steganogrophy is a form of hiding your information and storing them on other
data streams, so the data is undetected from prying eye, which is very
effective method when you want hide information that are not permitted to
access on that certain place.

There are various type steganography such as: image, video and text data,
so let me introduce one type called image data which are easy to learn and
apply for all beginners.


## Tools Used:

Below are some common tools that you will need in order to learn
about image steganographic.

### Tool: steganography tool.
This is very important tools you should download on your system and get to learn.
There are two popular image tools which I would like to introduce in
this post: **hide4PG** for Windows and **SteganTool**  and also for linux
distros such **Gnu Privacy Guard (gpa) with gnu tools and also another tools**

I have included below some steps that can be applied in stegtool:

```

   steganalysis -a <input-image> [-i <key-file> [-v] | --steganalysis
        Perform Steganalysis on a cover image
       Options:
        <input-image>
                  Input Image.
                  This must contain a steganalytis signature in order for it to be analyzed.
                  A valid image signature file name should contain.sig and be named the
                  same name of image, but.sig will be used as extension.
                  For instance a.jpg will become <input-image>.sig file name for
                .sig.
                  Note : The <input_image> can have.ppm or.bmp or.pgm
                         extensions and can be of different image types, not only JPEG or PPM

        [-v],  [-verbose]
                   Turn ON/OFFF the debug information to help with bug report

         --key_file=<file_name>
        --signature_file_name =<sig-file>
```
This tool is useful for analyzing your hidden files.
Here you are a link where you can get it for both of
operatinng system

```

```
Now you should learn how it's applied and learn to install tools.


## Learning Step: Installing steg tool.
You are going now download and extract file that you just
 downloaded from website link.

Here's what we're going to learn:
1: Install it by simply run command as
`python setup install `
and if it is already
install run python steg install.

Now it will ask about steg file, choose any image you have with
.jpg extension.

## How Steg Tool Work.

StegTool allows users to store encrypted text within an image using steganography. Here is a simplified
flow chart for this technique.

*   **Choose your stegimage**. This will allow you select
an image from any directory to
encrypt message into
it
*  **Insert the image that is steg**
  You select the image
*   Insert the file
 that will
 encrypt
    This can
be of any
extension such.pdf or any file you
have with
*.doc extension and more

You need also
add the text file to insert inside image
Here's some step by
 step to do steganography:
Here's example for image

### How It Is Used?

To get a basic understanding, let me show
how Steg Tool
can help to you to get information and
also how can
be used in steganographic.

```

Here's the simple way how I use it. Let say we have to hide our file into image.

Step 1) Create your message with a text file.

Here is the file created by myself.
Here you can download a text
file.

[Click
to Download]

[download.txt](https://www.gpg-tools.org/steg/download/1)

Here I used simple
`"secret" "file"`

Now let me encrypt
it.

[Step 1]: Encrypt a text

```sh

$ steganography encrypt –image
<IMAGE.jpg> –key 0x0
 –key “password”
  -message <message>

```


You may
ask, "How is image related with this command? I just need encrypt my file." Here,
Stegtool can be applied to encrypt the message
inside any
 image using Steganographic.

Step2:
Create cover image to use. (This must
have
extension of.jpg or any type you prefer.

[Here, is a example I made
for
example
image](image.png).
[download](https:www.gpg-tools.org/steg/ download/image)
Now,
once your message is inserted
into an
 image
file, it looks
just a image as you normally do. Now we need encrypt it
with the command above

[steg encrypt
message “message”
-image “path” “path to message file”

This can help to store any data
inside of image.


**Step 3**:


Once your steg file
has been encrypted and ready,
use Steg tool for
Steg Tool.
```
````
$ steg tool –extract –message <key> –cover image –secret message


[Steganalyser]
You will have the same result as your first steganalysing. If
message file does not have an steganalytic file,
message is undetectable to pryeers and also not able
detect from admin or others to see message.
