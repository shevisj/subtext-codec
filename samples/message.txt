Today, I'm going to teach you about steganography.  Now I know what some people might say - isn't that just a bunch of jumbled nonsense, and isn't steganalysis what all those spy shows use for cover ups and hidden information. But, actually, no! Steganography has its roots in cryptography, but is not exactly about encrypt or decrypt data. Its main goal, rather, is about hiding, well, data!

### So what exactly does stegno mean?
The term 'Stegnography', has two roots - one Greek root "Stego-" and "Graptō", the latter means "write". Together, Stego-graphtō, can roughly translate into - to write under a cloak, or, in a broader context - hide the meaning by not changing the original text.

Stegnography uses different methods, and it all starts with image. Let me illustrate:

-   **Cover Images** 
   The first step in steganographic techniques, we select images which are to be covered and to which we are to add the message (in binary) into it - these cover image is the first step to encode data.

    ![]()
     </img></p>
       Image is being used as the first and the final layer.

   -  <h4>Cipher</4>

     A stegano message or an embedded message will go on this, after some of its bit is hidden inside our cover Image.


     The process works with following step:

1  <h5>Capture and Select the cover images</h5>
1.1    We can capture the cover images either using our mobile device or from any website.
   After selecting we can resize the images in different formats, to hide our secret data (like text messages) using different techniques, so that the final result looks same. 


    **1  <u>Select Secret data and Resize image to embed secret text inside the cover image</h2>**


      To hide data into cover images first convert the cover images and data you want to embed (text data in ASCII, which has 128 different character set ) in binary. Now let’s resize the images. The smaller you go with an Image the higher quality image it gives.


      To encode data on images is known to have an impact in terms of its quality. There's no need to encode large amounts data using small images.
 
      -    <u>1   Data compression algorithms used to embed message on Cover image</h2></p> 
 
 
     To make images small (less KB in size )we have algorithms such as LZW (Lemple,Ziv and Weiner). 
   -    <u>1    Encoding secret messages with Binary ( ASCII  ) data using the ASCII code ( A= 65,Z = 90 etc.  and A-Z  = ASCII codes are between  32 to 126, so the 7-bit code is sufficient ) </u>
      In encoding we convert every characters ( letters and symbols, both) to the 8 bit ( Binary ) ASCII value. We convert 8 bits  ASCII to a binary number. This  will enable you to  read and  embed message (data) on our image in form of bit, this will  enable you  to add our data  in any cover images  in the binary form,  we convert the entire  cover  into a binary and store data into that and add in the images in different locations like pixel ( red and blue color in  8-bit  pixel value). 

-    <h4>Cyphertext (Encoded text)</4>
-     In encoding message to hide on the cover image. After all process now we need to store secret data and image in different locations on the pixel in cover images.
 

 
     The secret  message and  the original message are hidden on pixel locations and can only be decoded  when we are done. It can also hide a text, image and even  any type of data on images.


     <u>CypherText </h4> : 
      - The original cover image and message  in which message is hidden (binary)
       **Decoding:**

-    To read data that is encoded into the cover image (original), the same steps used to embed data (in our previous explanation of how encoding process  happens  for our data). In  reverse order and  read it to see original image  as it is.



      Now I'm not sure whether it’s the correct process as I’m trying it out but let me give it a go!

So what I did was that,  to create a hidden secret message within my picture using a method called "least significant bit" substitution.


So basically,  I changed the pixels (the smallest dots of a picture), one pixel at a  time and the  message is encoded  and hidden, but when I viewed the encoded message with an  steganalyis program and viewed the decoded image using a different program  the result looked almost the  exact same! So in essence, the  hidden  secret message in the image could be seen when viewing it with steganalysis but when the original picture is shown in it, there isn't  even any sign that  there was ever even any message there to be hidden!

### So is this stegnographic method of data embedding the  only method or technique available out there to us, for hiding secret information within the original  cover images or  files. 

**Not even close to it**

While stegnographic methods  of  data hiding in pictures have  many of the  applications like:

  **Secure data sharing  of images with friends or in groups, or sending images over networks**
  
    There's more advanced  stegnography technique to use for secure information transfer  with more complexity of embedding a data, such as

1   <u>LSBs substitution </u>

      It has its application  as the previous example in steganography of image steganography.
