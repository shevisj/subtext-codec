Today, I'm goin to teach you about steganography.  It is the art and practice of concealin' information in a non-secret way, like in a seemingly innocous image or message.
There is a famous stegnographic method called "Least Significant Bit" (LSB) substitution, where the least significnt bits are replaced with a secret message.  For example if you have a pixel value of 128 (binary 1000,000), the least significant bits would be 0.  If the secret message bit was a "1", you could replace that 0 bit to get 129 (binary 100,0.000).  
There are also more advanced methods like "Spatial domain steganography", "Frequency Domain Steganography" (which is similar but uses a different way of lookin at the data), "Spread spectrum steganography", and more.
Steganalysis is the process and methods of detect and reveal hidden information. There is a variety of techniques used to do so.
Steganalysis is a very important part in the digital forensic science, and it is used to detect hidden information in digital images, videos and audio files.
There is a lot more to stegano than just this. I'm just scratch the surface here.
I'm glad you're intested, and I'm happy to answer more questions and provide more info.  Just let me out what you're interested and I'll be glad help.  -D
